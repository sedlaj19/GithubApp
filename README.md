# GithubApp
Sample app to display all public repositories from github with some details

The app is written in Kotlin.

I did not play with the UI, I just implemented the most basic UI without much work. It is really a simple app, which just shows the data. It uses kind of MVP pattern and few dependencies for showing images and make background tasks.
